Client Email Finder (CEF)

Note:	You can use 2Day trial version of a CEF.
Instruction for using CEF:
  1)	Run the CEF Version 2.3.2.
  2)	Enter the link, and press the “Find Email” button.
  3)	CEF will start scraping the internal and external link from the given blog site.
    a)	Because this is a client finder tool, so (it will categorize the links) ignore the internal link.
    b)	It will follow the external link and then look for its email.
  4)	When complete site is scraped, then it’ll move on the next section (email finding) automatically.
Points to be noted:
  1)	The CEF may close automatically during trial version right at first launch (After installation) or at the 2nd launch, but don't worry just launch it again and it won't happen again.
  2)	When CEF shows: “------------ Website is Finished ----------------”:
    a)	Make sure: Right above the (“------------ Website is Finished ----------------”) CEF isn't displaying “Check your internet connection.”
    b)	If CEF displayed the message “Check your internet connection.”: Then it means your internet is either too slow / Not working at all.
